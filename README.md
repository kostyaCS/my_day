# my_day
Module represent my day with help of FSM. There are a few states that I have:
1. Sleeping
2. Running
3. Eating
4. Working
5. Walking out
6. Reading

The day begins with sleeping, eating, than working, eating, walking out, working, eating and reading.
Typical day before session:)
There are a few random states, as running, walking out on Friday. I can go to sleep instantly without reading or going for a walk with some beer if it's Friday. For example:
